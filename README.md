# Waveform Definition Dashboard

In today’s world, every company that provides AI solutions for the creative fields
are providing solutions for the complex tasks but no service provides the education
about the simple basics that act as fundamental to the music production.

This project, Waveform Definition using Natural Language Processing, Speech
Recognition, Web Scraping and Informative Dashboard solves the problem
that is faced by the new and young music producers that want to produce music
but do not know the basic sound properties of the sound.

Using the NLP, Speech Recognition and the Dashboarding technology, the aim is to
create such a tool that can solve the problem of the new producers. The User can
give the input in the form of a text or a voice input.
The system finds the keywords from the given input, searches for the relevant
information on the net and then shows the output on the dashboard in such an
informative way that is easy to understand as well as compact at the same time.

This is a project proposed by Puru Vyas (19EJDAI036), student of Artificial
Intelligence IV Year. 

##Why this project?

In today’s world, there are too many young people who are exposed to the audio
technology and wish to work in the field but unfortunately they are not in a place
where they can get formal training over the concepts of Audio and Waves or they
are not mature enough to understand the terminologies as they are in the first
place.

This project aims to solve that problem by providing a simple yet very informative
solution to the problem. Our Dashboard will show the user the basic information
on a certain type of wave and the sound structure of the same.
